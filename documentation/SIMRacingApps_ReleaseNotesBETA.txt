    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page will install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    4. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com`
       for more details and options for running the server.
    
    Electron Client:

    Overwolf Client:

        WARNING: 
            THERE IS AN OVERWOLF BUG THAT CAUSES IT TO TAKE OVER YOUR USB INPUT DEVICES
            WHENEVER YOU CLICK ON AN APP. THIS CAN CAUSE IT TO SHIFT DOWN, LOOSE FORCE FEEDBACK,
            AND OTHER DISASTROUS THINGS. SO, DO NOT CLICK ON AN APP WHILE IN THE CAR.
            If you do, go into the garage and come back out and it will reset your devices.
            I have posted the issue to the forums.
