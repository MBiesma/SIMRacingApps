    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page will install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
    
    Electron Client:
        To install or update Electron Launcher, 
        1. Download the .SRA file's latest version from http://electron.SIMRacingApps.com 
        2. Make sure Electron is not running and start the SIMRacingAppsServer.exe
        3. Connect to the main menu from a browser and upload the .SRA file
        4. Refer to the Electron's readme file for more information
        
    Overwolf Client:
        To install or update Overwolf Launcher, 
        1. Download the .OPK file's latest version from http://overwolf.SIMRacingApps.com
        2. Open Overwolf's Dock and load it from Settings -> Support -> Development Options -> Install
           TODO: Submit the package to the Overwolf Store so it can be installed from there. 
        3. Refer to the instructions in the readme file to install this file into Overwolf.
        WARNING: 
            THERE IS AN OVERWOLF BUG THAT CAUSES IT TO TAKE OVER YOUR USB INPUT DEVICES
            WHENEVER YOU CLICK ON AN APP. THIS CAN CAUSE IT TO SHIFT DOWN, LOOSE FORCE FEEDBACK,
            AND OTHER DISASTROUS THINGS. SO, DO NOT CLICK ON AN APP WHILE IN THE CAR.
            If you do, go into the garage and come back out and it will reset your devices.
            I have posted the issue to the forums.
